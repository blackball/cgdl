This is an implementation of the agglomerative clustering presented in [0]. There's 
simple example presented in *example.c*, it simply group the pixels in the first picture
using *GDL*, and the second picture is the output. The codes was tested on Win7 using VS2010, 
and it should work in Linux too. 

You need install the OpenCV library to run *example.c*.
