This is an implementation of the agglomerative clustering algorithm   
presented in [0]. There's an example presented in *example.c*. It   
simply grouped the pixels in the first picture using *GDL*, the second   
picture is the output. The codes was tested on Win7 using VS2010, and   
it should work in Linux system too.   
  
You need install the OpenCV (1.0+) library to run *example.c*.  
  
The author also open sourced his Matlab implementation in :
